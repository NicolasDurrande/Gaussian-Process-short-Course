The first half of this lab session is dedicated to designing the best possible DoE. In the second one, we will run the actual experiments.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Design of experiments}
The aim of this section is to define a DoE of 40 points over $(0,1)^4$ that shows good space filling properties and good projection properties. Some useful functions (such as \texttt{discrepancy}, \texttt{minimax}, \texttt{maximin}, \texttt{IMSE}) are provided in the file \texttt{lab2.py}. The file \texttt{SobolSequence.py} will also be of particular interest to generate low discrepancy sequences.

% \subsection*{Questions}
\paragraph{Q1.} Write a function that implements a Latin Hypercube Design. The function should take as parameters the number of points $n$ and the dimension $d$. It should return a np.array with shape $(n,d)$.

\paragraph{Q2.} Write a function that returns a Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation. You may use a k-means or a McQueen algorithm. The inputs and outputs should be as in Q1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Running the experiments}


\paragraph{Q3.} Generate various DoE with $n=30$ points in dimension $d=4$ using the functions you just wrote (you may also consider \texttt{SobolSequence}).

\paragraph{Q4.} Choose your favorite DoE using the various space filling criteria. Do not forget to test the projections on some variables. Justify your choice in the report.

\paragraph{Q5.} Save your best design in a file (csv for example).

\paragraph{Q6.} Run the experiments with the simulator and save the outputs in a file.
